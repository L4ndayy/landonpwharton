                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Hello! I am Landon Wharton! I am a male, so my preferred pronouns are he/him/his. I am 18 years old. Some more information about my background is that I live in a family of four, which includes my mom, my dad, and my sister in suburban Michigan. I grew up in Livonia, MI; and currently reside in Green Oak, MI. I have attended three public schools in my lifetime,
                     which are the following: Brummer Elementary School, Millennium Middle School, and am enrolled in South Lyon High School. I am Catholic, and I am an active parish member at St. Patrick Catholic Parish located in Brighton Michigan. I attend Sunday mass as well
                     as Sunday and Wednesday evening Young Church. Next year, I will be attending a four-year college/university, which I will update this page with as soon as I decide which school I will be attending this fall. Some of my skills are that I have lifeguard, First Aid, CPR, and concussion detection certifications. Besides water-based activies, I enjoy several online activities too. Some as listed are coding in the HTML and CSS language, and graphic design. On my
                projects page, you will see a link that directs you to a flyer I made for my high school swim team. For other skills and a more detailed list of my work experience and awards, check out my resume (COMING SOON)
                on my projects tab as well. Cheers!
